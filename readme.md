# Smart Brain Face Recognition API
This is the API for an exercise I completed while learning Node and Express. It handles PUT and POST for user registration, sign in, and entry count.
__NOTE: This is a work in progress; I blew the repo away and restarted to refresh my knowledge.__

## Getting Started
